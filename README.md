# Welcome to archived project of ECD School for the Deaf Minecraft Recreate!

## What is this project?
A team of former ECDHS students built Minecraft version of E.C. Drury School for the Deaf campus for the school's 60th anniversary. This world was built in Minecraft 1.19.3 to 1.19.4 via [PaperMC](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper). We were hosting public Minecraft server in May 28th to August 8, 2023.

> In a world where imagination knows no bounds, one dedicated group of alumni embarked on a remarkable journey. Their mission is to recreate a place where their dreams could thrive, where every brick, every texture, and every signpost has been carefully crafted to create an immersive experience that reflects the school's values of inclusivity, education, and community and celebrate the school's 60th anniversary.

> Welcome to the E.C. Drury School for the Deaf, where in the realm of Minecraft, dreams become reality.

## Exported World files
We exported ECD Campus into the world folder for single-player in Minecraft Java Edition client. So, people can download, import, and improve the campus in future!

This was built in Java Edition 1.19.3 to 1.19.4. You may upgrade or convert it to newer version.

For import/export, you can find your Minecraft world files in the following locations, depending on your Operating System:

Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\`

GNU/Linux: `~/.minecraft/saves/`

Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/`

## Exported Schematics
We exported ECD Campus into schematic files. So, people can download, import, and improve the campus in future!

- `schematic\ecd-campus.construction` Construction Java 1.19.4
- `schematic\ecd-campus.mcstructure` mcstructure Bedrock 1.19.70
- `schematic\ecd-campus.schem` Sponge Schematic Java 1.19.4 
- `schematic\ecd-campus.schematic` Schematic Java 1.19.4

## Custom Image
To use custom image, please download and use plugin [Custom Images by Andavin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/custom-images.53036/) on PaperMC or SpigotMC setup. Than download and import `images` folder from this repo into plugin folder. It came with database and image files. The database are compatible with the exported world file, not exported schematics. Exported schematics will require manually place image via in-game.

This plugin was tested and worked on multi-player mode server. We do not test it on single-player mode client.
