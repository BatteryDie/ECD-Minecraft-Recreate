## A message from ECD School for the Deaf Minecraft Recreate team

Hi!

We are sorry that we closed our public Minecraft server on August 8, 2023. We had few of visitors during May 28, 2023 to August 8, 2023. They were very impressed and proud of us!

We publicly released the world and schematic files:
- Our GitHub Repo [https://github.com/BatteryDie/ecd-minecraft-recreate](https://github.com/BatteryDie/ecd-minecraft-recreate)
- Internet Archive [https://archive.org/details/ECD-Minecraft-Recreate](https://archive.org/details/ECD-Minecraft-Recreate)
- Planet Minecraft [https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/ecd-school-for-the-deaf-minecraft-recreate/)

Of course, you can play or improve the ECD campus in Minecraft single-player or online in future!

Any question, please contact us:
- Email: `admin@ecdschool.ca`
- Discord/TwitterX: `@batterydie`

**Thank you so much for visiting our public Minecraft server and website! ðŸ‘‹**
